What is the Advent of Code
--------------------------

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a
> variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming
> language you like.

Usage
-----

Running `make` from the top-level should run code for all days of the advent.
To run just a single day, either run e.g. `make 01` or `cd 01 && make`.
